    """
    Tree of shapes of a 2d image.

    The Tree of Shapes was described in [1]_.
    The algorithm used in this implementation was first described in [2]_.

    The tree is computed in the interpolated multivalued Khalimsky space to provide a continuous and autodual representation of
    input image.

    Possible values of `padding` are `'none'`, `'mean'`, and `'zero'`.
    If `padding` is different from 'none', an extra border of pixels is added to the input image before
    anything else. This will ensure the existence of a shape encompassing all the shapes inside the input image
    (if exterior_vertex is inside the extra border): this shape will be the root of the tree.
    The padding value can be:

      - 0 if :attr:`padding` is equal to ``"zero"``;
      - the mean value of the boundary pixels of the input image if :attr:`padding` is equal to ``"mean"``.

    If :attr:`original_size` is ``True``, all the nodes corresponding to pixels not belonging to the input image
    are removed (except for the root node).
    If :attr:`original_size` is ``False``, the returned tree is the tree constructed in the interpolated/padded space.
    In practice if the size of the input image is :math:`(h, w)`, the leaves of the returned tree will correspond to an
    image of size:

      - :math:`(h, w)` if :attr:`original_size` is ``True``;
      - :math:`(h * 2 - 1, w * 2 - 1)` is :attr:`original_size` is ``False`` and :attr:`padding` is ``"none"``; and
      - :math:`((h + 2) * 2 - 1, (w + 2) * 2 - 1)` otherwise.

    :Advanced options:

    :attr:`immersion` defines if the initial image should be first converted as an equivalent continuous representation
    called a *plain map*. If :attr:`immersion` is set to ``False`` the level lines of the shapes of the image may intersect
    (if the image is not well composed) and the result of the algorithm is undefined (the algorithm will arbitrarily
    break level lines to get a set of shapes forming a tree). If :attr:`immersion` is ``False``, the result size will be:

      - :math:`(h, w)` if :attr:`original_size` is ``True`` or if :attr:`padding` is ``"none"``;
      - :math:`(h + 2, w + 2)` otherwise.

    :attr:`Exterior_vertex` defines the linear coordinates of the pixel corresponding to the exterior
    (interior and exterior of a shape is defined with respect to this point). The coordinate of this point must be
    given in the padded/interpolated space.
