Developing c++ extensions
=========================

While Higra provides many vectorized operators to implement algorithms efficiently in Python, it is possible that
some operations cannot be done efficiently in Python.

In such case, the `Higra-cppextension-cookiecutter <https://github.com/higra/Higra-cppextension-cookiecutter>`_ enables
to easily setup and generate c++ extension using Higra with Python bindings.
